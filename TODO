all in net.minecraft are 3-part-classes, minecraft forge and cpw.mods.fml can be different
load world automatically on start?
all todo to throw exception?

how does intermediary work? how handles 1.7.10 method/event to 1.2.5 block?



no abstract "real" classes!
continue rework!

https://skmedix.github.io/ForgeJavaDocs/javadoc/forge/1.7.10-10.13.4.1614/net/minecraft/world/gen/structure/MapGenVillage.html

Interface methods:
	get_XXX() - returns member variable
	XXXSuper(PARAMS) - calls super.XXX(PARAMS)

for entity mapping where witchery registers its entities into a map, maybe subclass HashMap and hande insertions differently...

--tweakClass org.spongepowered.asm.launch.MixinTweaker --mixin mixins.compatibility.json


Sources:
Eclipse-> Bluild Path-> Add class folder - TEMP_CLASSES
Eclipse project add new source folder (TEMP_CLASSES).
Decompile, put next to .class
start, stop, refresh project explorer
Debug configurations _> Add both to sources and class path


one compatibility layer für alle? Try merge 1.7.10 and 1.10... afterwards, rename .de.dark...sandbox to /compatibility/sandbox/

goblins witchery compatibility (java.lang.reflect.Constructor Mixin)

forge tries create mod objects
-> Mixin append code before return in Contructor.newInstance. When "instanceof Compat_Entity", cast to Compat_Entity and invoke .toReal()
- Code in mod calls Compat_Constructor.newInstance, might need to call getFake or so.

Think again: Why "Mod_Block -> Wrapper_Block -> MC_Block" nicht möglich?



no new Compat_Item allowed!

instanceof abfangen oder doublewrap verhinern...?




All mod classes tagged? When usin @Callback, switch on version (CASE V1_7_10 Call_XX, CASE V1_10_2 Call_YY). in constructor, get and save version.
factory checks if child, if yes, creates wrapper.
if this.getClass != Compat_XXX.class then is child
HasCallback with MC Versions, to know it is called for version XXX
find all called methods, like overrides - find method that call into mod class, but are inherited from non-mod.


different sandbox for different mc version, but same mc sandbox... could be problematic in Compat_Class.forName

cache for same build version

always disable dump classes for release
reobj Real classes for production
Mixin into mods only possible starting with 1.14 ?!
