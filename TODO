Enable all exceptions in eclipse, some exceptions are "swallowed" by Witchery, e.g. in preInit.
all in net.minecraft are 3-part-classes, minecraft forge and cpw.mods.fml can be different
load world automatically on start?
all todo to throw exception?
autogenerate real blocks?

how does intermediary work? how handles 1.7.10 method/event to 1.2.5 block?
in CompatReal_ classes, somehow force classes to override methods like isNormalBlock. Runtime reflection check, for each "super" method, there must be a normal one


no abstract "real" classes!
continue rework!

Interface methods:
	get_XXX() - returns member variable
	XXXSuper(PARAMS) - calls super.XXX(PARAMS)

for entity mapping where witchery registers its entities into a map, maybe subclass HashMap and hande insertions differently...
